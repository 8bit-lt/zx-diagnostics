zx-diagnostics
==============

Firmware to allow functional testing of ZX Spectrum hardware and related clones.

Based on firmware written by Dylan Smith for his Spectrum Diagnostic Board.
(Archive of that project page is available here: http://www.comportec.de/diag/www.alioth.net/Projects/Spectrum-Diag/)

Hardware schematics (and eventually PCB gerbers) originally by Dylan Smith, updates by Guesser and Mark Kinsey (1024MAK).
